## ðŸŽ¯ Goal of the Day  
- Set up the Unity development environment

## âœ… What I Did  
- [x] Installed Unity Hub  
- [x] Installed Unity Editor (2022.3 LTS)  
- [x] Installed Visual Studio (updated)  
- [x] Created first 2D project  
- [x] Watched Unity basic tutorials  
- [x] Created a Notion folder for study logs  
- [x] Created GitHub account and repository

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned  
1. **Hierarchy**: Shows a list of GameObjects in the Scene (used to create and organize objects)  
2. **Scene**: Workspace to place and arrange GameObjects (visual editor view)  
3. **Inspector**: Panel to view and edit a GameObject's Components (such as color, size, position)  
4. **GameObject**: An empty container; gains functionality by adding Components  
5. **Duplicate**: Clone a GameObject to create an identical copy

## ðŸ’­ Reflections & Difficulties  
The terminology in Unity is unfamiliar and a bit challenging,  
but by experimenting directly with the tools, I began to understand how things are structured.

Passive learning through just watching videos doesnâ€™t work well for me.  
I need to **touch, try, and build things myself** to truly understand how they work.
