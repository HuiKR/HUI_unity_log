🎯 Goal of the Day
Understand the basics of Unity’s 2D physics using Rigidbody2D

Observe how objects fall and collide

Record today’s progress and findings in Notion

✅ Tasks Done
 Reviewed key concepts from Day 1

 Practiced using Hierarchy, Scene, and Inspector panels

 Created a “falling block” that drops and collides with the floor

 Moved the object left and right to explore position manipulation

📚 What I Learned
Every GameObject acts as a container. Child objects can be structured hierarchically.
(e.g., A Player object can have a Body object, which itself can have Arm/Leg child objects)

For simpler games like platformers, one Body object is often enough.

For two objects to collide, both need a Collider,
and at least one of them needs a Rigidbody2D component.

To rotate a square object in 2D view, you rotate it around the Z-axis, not X or Y.

Tip: Think of drawing on paper and turning it using your fingers as pivot points.

Linear Drag is like air resistance — it slows down motion, acting like a brake.

Gravity in Unity is a force vector applied as (0, -9.81) by default.

Setting Gravity Scale to 2 makes it (0, -19.62), meaning the object falls faster.

💬 Reflections & Challenges
Since I’m not making a full game yet, this is the perfect time to experiment freely.

I need to get familiar with how physics values interact — like combining Gravity and Drag.

I’ve found a good direction, so I’ll stay consistent, not rush, and take it step by step.
